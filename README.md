# PredictaDrive 

## Developer Setup Instructions 
In order to properly run and test PredictaDrive, you'll need to get both the server and frontend running:

1. Clone this repository onto your local machine and open in your code editor of choice.
2. Open a terminal and `cd` into `/server`.
3. Run `npm install` and then `npm start`. This should start the server on `localhost:4000`. You can test that it's working by navigating to [this test address](http://localhost:4000/nft/0x48f6EdC54Ae0706b5e6cFC33C342B49bf2dDb939). 
4. In a new terminal window, ensure that you're in the root directory, and add in your `.env` as discussed.
5. While you're still in the root directory, run `npm install` and `npm run dev`. This will startup the frontend. You can test that it's working by navigating to: http://localhost:5173/
